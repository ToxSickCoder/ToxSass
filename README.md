# ToxLESS
## Introduction
A small LESS framework written for websites or web applications. I wrote this to easily create beautiful websites within the same theme. Feel free to use this or to build upon this. This project uses the GPL V2 license.

## How to use
If you want to use this for your project you can do two things:

Either you can grab the source files in the **SRC** folder and start edit the LESS files. You can also use the **toxLESS.min.js** file from the **css** folder and go from there.
